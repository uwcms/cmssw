L1TCaloLayer1RawToDigi contains CMSSW EDProducer which decodes
Layer-1 calorimeter trigger data obtained from its three FEDs.

The producer makes ECAL and HCAL TPG objects.

These should be identical to the ones read out from ECAL TCCs
and HCAL uHTRs.  However, any link issues could result in 
discrepancies.  

DQM based on this readout compares these two sets.

The test python file here just prints the non-zero and error
data for the first five events for the given raw data file.

There is also a simple standalone tester and two test events that you can try:

  cd $CMSSW_BASE/src/EventFilter/L1TCaloLayer1RawToDigi/test/
  c++ testUCTUnpacker.cpp
  ./a.out < event_test1.txt
